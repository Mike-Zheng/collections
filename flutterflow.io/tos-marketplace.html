            <li><strong>Paid Services</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <ol role="list">
            <li><strong>General</strong>. Certain aspects of the Marketplace, including the Seller Content, may be provided for a fee or other charge. If you elect to use paid aspects of the Marketplace, you agree to our Pricing and Payment Terms, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein, as we may update them from time to time. For any transaction you make through the Marketplace, you agree that a certain percentage of the total transaction amount, as described in the Pricing and Payment Terms, may be paid to or retained by Company, and you acknowledge that we may update this percentage and/or our compensation scheme from time to time. You also acknowledge that any transaction made through the Marketplace may be subject to Third-Party Fees (as defined below), as described in the Pricing and Payment Terms. Company may add new services or Seller Content for additional fees and charges, and may add or amend fees and charges for existing services or Seller Content, at any time, in its sole discretion. Any change to our Pricing and Payment Terms will become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in the Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by Company in writing, Buyer will not pay any Seller directly for any services or Seller Content provided through or in connection with the Marketplace.</li>
            <li><strong>Definitions</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>‚Äú<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>‚Äù means the recurring amount Buyer pays as consideration for a subscription to Seller Content and any other services the Seller may offer to subscribed Buyers (‚Äú<strong>Subscription</strong>‚Äù); such fee is the sum of the applicable Company Fee, the Seller Fee, and any applicable Third-Party Fees.</p>

          <p>‚Äú<strong>Seller Fee</strong>‚Äù means the portion of the Subscription Fee that is owed by Company to a Seller as consideration for such Seller‚Äôs provision of Seller Content.</p>
          <p>‚Äú<strong>Third-Party Fees</strong>‚Äù means, individually and collectively, the portions of the Subscription Fees and Seller Fees retained by third parties such as Apple, Stripe, Inc.

          <p>To the extent that Company collects Seller Fees from Buyer for transmission to a Seller, it does so on behalf of such Seller as such Seller‚Äôs limited payment collection agent. Accordingly, payment of the Seller Fees to Company will be considered the same as payment of Seller Fees made directly by Buyer to a Seller. Upon Buyer‚Äôs payment of Seller Fees to Company, Buyer‚Äôs payment obligation to a given Seller is extinguished in an amount equal to the payment for Seller Fees made to Company, and Company is responsible for remitting such Seller Fees to such Seller (less any applicable Third-Party Fees).¬†</p>
          <p>In connection with payments of Fees, Buyer will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address, and credit card information to Company or its third-party payment processor (which may include, without limitation, [Apple or Stripe]). Buyer hereby authorizes the collection of such amounts by charging the Buyer‚Äôs designated payment method or credit or debit card, either directly by Company or indirectly via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Marketplace. If Buyer is directed to Company‚Äôs third-party payment processor, Buyer will be subject to terms and conditions governing the use of that third party‚Äôs service and to that third party‚Äôs personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using such third party‚Äôs services.

          <p>‚Äú<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>‚Äù means the recurring amount a User pays as consideration for a subscription to Seller‚Äôs Seller Content and any other services Seller may offer to subscribed Users (‚Äú<strong>Subscription</strong>‚Äù); such fee is the sum of the applicable Company Fee, the Seller Fee, and any applicable Third-Party Fees.</p>
          <p>‚Äú<strong>Company Fee</strong>‚Äù means the portion of the Subscription Fee that Company may retain as consideration for providing the Marketplace.</p>
          <p>‚Äú<strong>Seller Fee</strong>‚Äù means the portion of the Subscription Fee that is owed by Company to Seller as consideration for Seller‚Äôs provision of Seller Content.</p>
          <p>‚Äú<strong>Third-Party Fees</strong>‚Äù means, individually and collectively, the portions of the Subscription Fees and Seller Fees retained by third parties such as Apple, Stripe, Inc. (‚Äú<strong>Stripe</strong>‚Äù), and other third-party payment processors that we may engage from time to time in our sole discretion.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li><strong>Compensation</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Seller acknowledges that Users will pay the fees, which may include the Subscription Fee, Company Fee, Seller Fee, and Third-Party Fees (together, the ‚Äú<strong>Fees</strong>‚Äù) through the Marketplace. Seller agrees that Company or any party designated by Company may collect Seller Fees owed to Seller as Seller‚Äôs limited payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting such funds, and Seller hereby appoints Company as its payment collection agent solely for such purpose. Seller agrees that any payment of Seller Fees (less the applicable Third-Party Fees) through or in connection with the Marketplace will be considered the same as a payment made directly to Seller, and Seller will provide the services offered to subscribed Users to a given User in the agreed-upon manner as if Seller received the payment of Seller Fees directly from such User. Upon successful payment to Company of the Seller Fees due to Seller by a User, such User‚Äôs payment obligation to Seller for the Seller Fees is terminated, and Company is solely responsible for remitting the funds it receives from such User to Seller, subject to the terms herein. Seller understands that Company‚Äôs obligation to pay Seller is subject to successful receipt of the Seller Fees from a given User, and Company is liable to Seller only for the payment of amounts it successfully receives from such User (less the applicable Company Fees and/or Third-Party Fees). Company assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of any User. Seller hereby authorizes Company to issue refunds to Users and agrees to comply with any refunds issued by Company.</p>
          <p>All payments from Company to Seller will be made by Company or the third-party payment processor of Company‚Äôs choice. Seller acknowledges and understands that third-party payment processors may retain Third-Party Fees, as described in the Pricing and Payment Terms, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein, whenever Company remits to Seller any Seller Fees. In the event a payment from a User that is directed to Seller is charged-back, refunded, or reversed, Company, in its sole discretion, may either (i) reduce or set off against any amounts to be remitted or otherwise due to Seller hereunder by an amount equal to such chargeback, refund, or reversal amount, or (ii) provided that Seller has already received the amounts, invoice Seller for an amount equal to such chargeback, refund, or reversal, and Seller will pay to Company such invoiced amount within thirty (30) calendar days of the invoice date.</p>
          <p>To ensure proper payment, Seller is solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate and complete contact and payment information associated with Seller‚Äôs User Account, including, without limitation, applicable tax information, and for maintaining an account with the third-party payment processor of Company‚Äôs choice, if needed. If we believe that we are obligated to obtain tax information related to Seller, and Seller does not provide this information to us after we have requested it, we may withhold payments due to Seller until Seller provides this information or otherwise satisfies us that Seller is not a person or entity from whom/which we are required to obtain such tax information. Any third-party fees related to returned or cancelled payments due to an error or omission in Seller‚Äôs contact or payment information may be deducted from the newly issued payment. If Seller disputes any payment made hereunder, Seller must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of such payment or from when Seller purports such payment would have been due, whichever is earlier. Failure to so notify us will result in the waiver by Seller of any claim relating to such disputed payment. Payment will be calculated solely based on records maintained by Company, and no other measurements or statistics of any kind will be accepted by Company or have any effect hereunder. Seller will have no audit rights hereunder.¬†</p>

            <li><strong>Non-Circumvention</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>You acknowledge and agree that a substantial portion of the compensation Company receives for making the Marketplace available is collected as described in the Pricing and Payment Terms, and that, in exchange, a substantial value to you is the relationships formed with the community of Users. Therefore, you agree to use the Marketplace as your exclusive method of interacting with a substantial portion of the community of Users who purchase your Seller Content, and you will not provide or otherwise make available Seller Content outside of the Marketplace. Additionally, you may not request through the Marketplace a Subscription Fee lower than that actually agreed upon between you and a User, or otherwise have a User transfer funds to you outside of the Marketplace in exchange for User‚Äôs use of the Marketplace, the Seller Content, or any portion thereof. For clarity, this Section 9 does not apply to your User Content that you otherwise own and make available outside of the Marketplace. If you use the Marketplace as an employee, agent, or representative of an entity, then the restrictions of this Section 9 apply to you and other employees, agents, and representatives of that entity or its successor.¬†</p>
          <p>You acknowledge and agree that a violation of this Section 9 is a material breach of the Agreement. If you violate the above terms set forth in this Section 9, in addition to any other right and remedy available to Company at law or in equity, Company may suspend or terminate your User Account and/or charge you US$500.00 for each such violation (each, a ‚Äú<strong>Non-Circumvention Payment</strong>‚Äù), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, on account of the great difficulty of ascertaining and proving the amount of such damage. In satisfaction of the Non-Circumvention Payment, Company may withhold any amounts due to Seller in connection with any future transaction or transactions made through the Marketplace to which Seller is a party, and Seller hereby authorizes Company to instruct its payment processor to remit all such amounts to Company.</p>
          <p>You agree to notify Company immediately if a User suggests to you making or receiving payments for the Seller Content other than through the Marketplace in violation of this Section 9. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this Section 9, please contact us at team+tos@flutterflow.io.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li><strong>Support and Disputes with Buyers. </strong>You acknowledge and agree that you will address any maintenance or support issues or disputes Buyers may have arising out of the Seller Content, and that customer support for Seller Content is the sole responsibility of Seller. Failing to provide proper customer support may result in the Seller or the Seller Content‚Äôs removal from the Marketplace. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users, including the Buyer. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Company shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User‚Äôs action or inaction.¬†</li>
            <li><strong>Release</strong>. You hereby release Company from all damages (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or otherwise), losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of a dispute between you and a third party (including other Users) in connection with the Marketplace. In addition, each User waives any applicable law or statute, which says, in substance: ‚ÄúA GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, AND THAT IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.‚Äù</li>
